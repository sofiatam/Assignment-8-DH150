**Description:**

My project improves upon Yelp by adding a "Discover" feature that includes subcategories "Trending," "Friends," and "Updates." The purpose of this prototyping phase is to outline the general flow of the feature I would like to implement. The process of creating a high fidelity prototype is to translate the low fidelity prototype into digital screens, then add logical flows from one screen to the next. Creating this prototype is useful for envisioning what the potential finished product would look and behave like.


**Supported tasks:**
- See trending restaurants in the area
- Hover over map
- See friends activity in the area
- See all updates on businesses in the area
- See updates posted directly by businesses ("From Business")
- See a friend's profile
- See profiles for all friends

**Graphical interface design decisions:**

Since my project is adding a feature to Yelp, I followed Yelp's color scheme and general aesthetic when building my graphical interface design. I did this in order to maintain consistency and emphasize the seamlessness of my implementation. I tried to use similar shapes, fonts, and processes as Yelp so that users would not be confused by my new flows. I did not consider accessibility for color contrast because I was following Yelp's color scheme.

**Revised prototypes:**

After the evaluation with others, I was advised to clarify what the "Updates" section meant. "Updates" encompasses a large variety of updates, so it would be better if I made different subsections within the category. So, I added the subsections "From Business," "Hours," and "Promotions" because these are the three categories any updates would fall under. You can see in my high fidelity prototype that I implemented this feedback and created a screen for "From Business" as an example.
